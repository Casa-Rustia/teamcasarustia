   <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      We are Ace and Vanna, partners in life, travel, and now remote work. Ace spent over a decade guiding tourists around the Philippines,
      managing travel experiences, and working with clients as an account executive. When the world shifted, so did he. First landing a role
      in case management for a UK e-commerce company, and eventually finding his stride as a project manager for a translation and localisation
      company in Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanna, on the other hand, was soaring high as a senior flight attendant for nearly ten years, offering world-class service to passengers from all walks of life.
      She took a leap into remote work, turning her voice and storytelling skills into a career in voice artistry, copywriting, and project coordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, we traded airports and offices for laptops and home studios - building a life that blends flexibility, creativity, and meaningful work with people
      from all over the globe.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      To build a world where remote work feels human. At Team Casa Rustia, we imagine a global community where skilled professionals
      from all walks of life can thrive, where flexibility fuels productivity, family comes first, and every project is built on trust.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We connect passionate people with purposeful work. Team Casa Rustia bridges the gap between businesses and exceptional remote talent.
      With heart-led service, professional excellence, and contagious enthusiasm, we make virtual staffing feel seamless and sincere.

          <h4>Co-Founder & Operations Director / Chief Operating Officer (COO)</h4>

            <p>
              From tour guiding to team building, Ace Rustia has mastered the art of getting people where they need to be—whether it’s a remote island or a remote job.
              He started as a Tour Guide and Travel Manager, making sure tourists didn’t miss the best spots (or the van). Now, he’s the Co-Founder and COO of Team Casa Rustia,
              managing global operations, virtual teams, and the occasional tech hiccup—all without leaving his house (or his coffee mug).
              Ace runs tight projects, juggles 15+ languages at a time, and still finds a way to keep things light.
              He’s your go-to guy for turning chaos into clarity—with a little humor and a lot of heart.
              Because let’s be real: if you can manage a bus full of jetlagged tourists, running a virtual company is just another adventure.

            <p>
              Ylona “Vanna” Rustia is the kind of woman who can switch from soothing voiceovers to juggling deadlines faster than you can say “mic check.”
              A professional voice artist, language project coordinator, and all-around communication wizard, Vanna turned her talent for storytelling and sharp attention to detail into a powerhouse role behind the scenes of global translation projects.
              She doesn’t just speak clearly—she thinks clearly, plans precisely, and keeps the whole ship sailing smoothly (even when the waters get rough).
              From directing voice work with perfect tone to coordinating diverse teams across time zones, she brings both warmth and whip-smart efficiency to every task.
              And yes—she is the voice behind that perfectly pronounced videos you watched without realizing it.
